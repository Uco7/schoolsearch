            {uni.abbreviation} ({uni.name}) is a {category.toLowerCase()} in {uni.location}, founded in {uni.founded}.
            JAMB's national minimum for {session} is {uni.cutOffMarks.jambNational}, though {uni.abbreviation}'s own
            institutional cut-off {uni.cutOffMarks.institutionalVerified ? "is confirmed at" : "is typically around"} {uni.cutOffMarks.institutional} —
            and competitive departments generally require more. Admissions for {uni.abbreviation}'s category of
            institution must conclude by {category === "Private University" ? deadlines.privateUniversities : deadlines.publicUniversities} this
            cycle. Meeting the cut-off is only the first step: Post-UTME screening, document preparation, and
            watching JAMB CAPS for your admission batch all matter just as much. For anything time-sensitive —
            exact fees, exact departmental cut-offs, exact dates — {uni.abbreviation}'s own{" "}
            <a href={uni.portalUrl} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official admission portal</a> is
            the authoritative source; this page is a starting point, not a substitute for it.
