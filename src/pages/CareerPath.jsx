    <p><strong>Where You Can Work:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Environmental agencies (e.g., NESREA)</li>
      <li>Research institutes and labs</li>
      <li>Agricultural firms and NGOs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Pure and Applied Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics)</h2>
    <p><strong>Current View:</strong> These fields are foundational but often underfunded in Nigeria. Still, they offer great potential for teaching, research, and innovation roles.</p>
    <p><strong>Job Prospects:</strong> Moderate, better with teaching or research credentials.</p>
    <p><strong>Where You Can Work:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Academic institutions (secondary & tertiary)</li>
      <li>Government research agencies</li>
